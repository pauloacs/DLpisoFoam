# Generate Data 3D

This folder contains examples of flow cases to generate data for training and automatically generate meshes and setting up the cases.

## Contents

- **flow_over_array_of_chips**: Simulates flow over an array of chip-like obstacles, representing heat sink geometries or electronic component arrays (includes isothermal and heated obstacle examples)
- **flow_over_array_of_cylinders**: Models flow around cylindrical obstacles arranged in an array pattern, useful for heat exchanger or structural applications (includes isothermal and heated obstacle examples)
- **flow_over_plate**: Simulates flow over an inclined flat plate geometry
- **wind_flow**: Represents atmospheric boundary layer wind flow scenarios for environmental or building aerodynamics applications
